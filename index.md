I'm a student in the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/). I am interested in the intersection of reinforcement learning in differentiable, physics-based environments and control. My main focus is theoretical, in that I want to develop algorithms with provable guarantees, but the ultimate goal is for these to also translate to practice, for example, to ensure better/safer control of medical apparatus or dynamic treatments.
